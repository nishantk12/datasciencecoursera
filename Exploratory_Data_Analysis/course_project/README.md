# Pollution data insights

There are 6 plots made as requried which answer some of the questions. <br/>
Code can be found in the code directory <br/> 
Plots and explainations are as below:

___

**Plot 1**

**Problem1** Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? <br>

Plot<br>

![Plot 1](https://github.com/nishantk12/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/course_project/plots/plot1.png)<br>

Observation<br>
As per the plot, total emission of PM2.5 has decreased over the years and the decrease rate was at minimum between 2002 and 2005. 

___


**Problem2** Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008?? <br>

![Plot 2](https://github.com/nishantk12/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/course_project/plots/plot2.png)<br>

Observation<br>
It can be observed from the plot that in Baltimore the total emission of PM2.5 has gone through different phases of increase and decrease alternatively in the 3 time ranges i.e. 1999-2002, 2002-2005 and 2005-2008 respectively. Although, in net, total emissions over the whole time range has reduced.

___

**Problem 3** Of the four types of sources indicated by the ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999‚Äì2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999‚Äì2008? 

![Plot 3](https://github.com/nishantk12/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/course_project/plots/plot3.png)<br>

Observation<br>
It can be seen from the plot that types "Nonpoint", "Non-road" and "On-road" emissions for PM2.5 has decreased over the time but for the type "Point" has increased for 2 time ranges i.e. 1999-2002 and then increased with a higher rate from 2002-2005. But it has seen a sharp decrease in the last range of years i.e. from 2005 to 2008. 

___

**Problem 4** Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999‚Äì2008?

![Plot 4](https://github.com/nishantk12/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/course_project/plots/plot4.png)<br>

Observation<br>
The coal emmission over the whole time range has decreased over the years, but it increased in the time range 1999-2002 and surprisingly remained constant between 2002 and 2005 but saw a decline from 2005 to 2008.

___

**Problem 5** How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999‚Äì2008 in Baltimore City?

![Plot 5](https://github.com/nishantk12/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/course_project/plots/plot5.png)<br>

Observation<br>
As per the type "onroad" in the Baltimore city, it can be seen that the emission has reduced over the years with a sharp decline from 1999-2002 and then steady declines between 2002 and 2008

___

**Problem 6** Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California. Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

![Plot 6](https://github.com/nishantk12/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/course_project/plots/plot6.png)<br>

Observation<br>
As can be seen from the graph that emission is much higher in city with fips as 06037 which is Los Angeles than Baltimore city which has fips as 24510. While in LA, the emission had increased in first 2 time periods and then decreased, while in Baltimore it has decresed with time.
